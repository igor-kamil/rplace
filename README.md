# Laravel r/place

This is another (and bit updated) variant of the app made in "[YouTube video: I built r/place with PHP and JavaScript in an hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSw5fFo0_pA)" from  [aschmelyun](https://twitter.com/aschmelyun).

Used Laravel 10 + Vite + Vue 3 + Tailwind. 

Made for the workshop in [Slovak National Gallery](https://umeleckecrevo.sng.sk). 

Feel free to re/use and re/create.
